# BinVis

BinVis is a web-based binary star system visualization tool, currently in development by Miguel Sep√∫lveda Huenchuleo, Astronomy student from Universidad de Chile, under the supervision of Prof. Rene A. Mendez, of the astronomy department.

For given set of orbital elements, the application runs a simulation of the stellar system or systems in a 3D space, and allows the user to compare the simulation to observational data. A tutorial describing the parameters and how to use the application is under development.

## Getting started
The project is currently hosted at [Github Pages](https://ashuenchuleo.github.io/BinVis/).
